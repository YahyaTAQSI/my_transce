So first things first we 

* install prisma and get shema generated [shema or prisma.shema is default file for config and it contains the models]
npm i prisma --save-dev

* init our project with prisma  [we use npx to execute prisma cli commands]
npx prisma init

* Creating models
 @unique --> throw an error if it is duplicated;
 @updatedAt --> ???

* migrate prisma models .. to real db [SEE created tables]
npx prisma migrate dev [generate sql file ??]
npx prisma migrate push 
npx prisma migrate deploy

what is _prisma_migrations table ??

<!-- Interaction with db -->
* adding database module that connect to prisma using Prisma Client, and connect to db $connect

* adding the products module that will be a Rest API [generate res]

* remove the dto & entities [already created by prisma "Prisma.ProductCreatInput"]

* why do we use the export in database.module and @Global()
and what is ProductCreatInput and ProductUpdateInput ??

* Adding relations btw Product and Description
  product Product @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id]) ??
